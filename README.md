# Graduate Student Satisfaction Survey
A repository for graduate student satisfaction survey development. GitHub will help address one of the key goals for the GSSS committee: Transparency.


## Contents
* gsss_questions.txt: Full list of questions before committee-based filtering down to the most relevant questions. Note that these text files can get funky, there is a specific lexicon required to run the script properly.
* gsss_slimmed_down.txt: Abbreviated survey which was sent out to folks in December 2023.
* IOB Graduate Student Satisfaction Survey.qsf: A QSF file to allow for easy import into Qualtrics. This is generated from gsss_slimmed_down.txt from parseqsf.py.
* parseqsf.py: the text file to Qualtrics conversion function.
